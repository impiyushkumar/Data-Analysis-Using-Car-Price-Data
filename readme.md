# Car Price Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze car price data through a structured approach of data cleaning, preparation, and visualization. The dataset contains information on various cars, including their features and prices. Our goal is to extract meaningful insights by exploring the relationships between features and car prices, focusing on both continuous and categorical data.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure that it was ready for analysis:

- **Handling missing values**: Missing data was addressed using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
- **Data normalization**: Certain features were normalized to standardize the data for accurate analysis.
- **Feature engineering**: New features were derived from the existing data to provide deeper insights.
- **Outlier detection and removal**: Outliers that could distort the analysis were identified and removed.

### 2. Data Visualization
Visualization plays a key role in identifying patterns and trends in the dataset. Various plots were used to understand the relationships between car prices and other features.

#### Visualizing Continuous Data:
- **Scatter plots** were used to observe correlations between car prices and continuous variables such as engine size, mileage, and car age.
- **Histograms** displayed the distribution of continuous variables to better understand their spread and skewness.

#### Visualizing Categorical Data:
- **Bar charts** and **box plots** were used to analyze categorical features like car brands, fuel types, and car models to explore their impact on car prices.
- **Heatmaps** were used to visualize correlations between different features, helping us understand the relationships among the variables.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used for data manipulation and visualization.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into how various factors affect car prices. By cleaning the data, preparing it for analysis, and applying visualization techniques, we could extract meaningful relationships between different features and car prices.

## Future Work
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models to predict car prices based on the available features.
- **Further Feature Engineering**: Explore advanced feature extraction methods to improve the quality of the analysis.
